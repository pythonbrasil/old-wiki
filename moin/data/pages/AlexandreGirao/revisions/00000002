 * How to reach me
  * alexgirao@gmail.com
 * A little about me
  * I believe and embrace the [http://www.gnu.org GNU]/[http://www.fsf.org FSF] philosophy
  * I'm a 'system engineer' (by interest/hobby, no academic degree)... or a kind of mad scientist if you prefer. I do love bits, bytes and all that frenzy confusion of zeros and ones flying around frenetically
  * I do linux{\ programming\,,\ administration\ and,\ security\ analysis} for living
  * I do surfing since i was 14teen, that's what holds my mental and physical health


Simple, simplex, complex... it's all a matter of concept zooming.
