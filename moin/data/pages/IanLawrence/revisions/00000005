Hi there. My name is * [http://ianlawrence.info/ Ian Lawrence] and if you made it this far (hey, this isn't exactly easy to find), it's either because you want something I have or know how to do, need to talk to me about something, or are curious about who I am. There's a bit about me below.

In 1992, I obtained an BA degree from the University of Portsmouth, where I defended my dissertation on recycling strategies.

I started working as a teacher. I then discovered computers and taught myself how to code in Cold Fusion. My first contract was at the BBC in London in 2000 and was a disaster. The masochistic side of me kept pushing me on to more contracts and then I found Free Software and Python and everything changed.
