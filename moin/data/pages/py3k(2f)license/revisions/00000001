'''História e Licença'''

 '''História do software'''

Python foi criado em meados de 1990 por Guido van Rossum no Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, veja http://www.cwi.nl/) na Holanda como um sucessor para a linguagem chamada ABC. Guido permanece o autor principal de Python, ainda que inclui muitas contribuições de outros.
Em 1995, Guido continou seu trabalho em Python no Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, veja http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/) em Reston, Virginia onde lançou diversas versões do software.

Em Maio de 2000, Guido e otime de desenvolvimento do núcleo Python mudaram-se para a Be''''''Open.com para formar time Be''''''Open Python''''''Labs. Em Outubro do mesmo ano, o time Python''''''Labs mudaram-se para Digital Creations (agora Zope Corporation; veja http://www.zope.com/). Em 2001, a Python Software Foundation (PSF, veja http://www.python.org/psf/) foi formada, uma organização sem fins lucrativos criado especificamente para tomar conta de toda propriedade intelectual relacionada a Python. Zope Corporation é o membro patrocinador da PSF.

Todas as versões de Python são Open Source (veja http://www.opensource.org/ para a definição de Open Source). Historicamente, muitas, mas não todas, as versões de Python são GPL-compatíveis; a tabela adiante sumariza as várias versões.

Todas as licenças Python, ao contrário da GPL, deixa você distribuir uma versão modificada sem fazer mudanças no código fonte. As licenças GPL-compatíveis tornam possível combinar Python com outros softwares que são lançados sob a licença GPL; os outros não. ||
 
Obrigado aos muitos voluntários de fora que trabalharam sob a direção de Guido para fazer estes lançamentos possíveis.
