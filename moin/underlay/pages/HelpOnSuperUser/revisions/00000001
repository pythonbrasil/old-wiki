Super users are one or more trusted user names with permission to do wiki-wide operations that are more than simple administration rights (usually handle [[HelpOnAccessControlLists|ACLs]], delete pages, revert content).

== What can a Superuser do? ==
 * Use despam action to mass revert edits of some user
 * Use SystemAdmin page
 * Make full backups
 * Install software  
 * Install Languages via SystemPagesSetup . 
 * In their settings screen, they have a list of other users they can temporarily "become" in order to help those users or even disable that account. Logging out puts them back into their regular account.

See HelpOnConfiguration to configure the super user, and some examples in HelpOnUserHandling and HelpOnPackageInstaller.
